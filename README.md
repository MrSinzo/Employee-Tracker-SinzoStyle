## What is it?
This is a fun little application that can access a database to add, update, or delete employee's, their roles, and departments they reside in.

## Why did I make this?
I wanted to make a quick application that could make performing queries ( and more! ) easier to accomplish, rather than opening up a word pad and trying to manipulate data manually. This makes it easier to update, delete and add new departments, roles and employees all from one command line, and the modifications can be viewed and referenced immediately!


## How did I go about building this?
There was A LOT of javascript involved, Mysql2 package, Inquirer (@8.2.4 version) an sequlize. This application is only served through the backend!
